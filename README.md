 Hi there 👋
===============
At the moment, I am working on a NextJS full-stack App. 


I’m a Software, Data Engineer passionate about designing scalable systems, data pipelines, and intelligent web applications that connect data to real-world impact.


At GFZ Potsdam (Fern.Lab), I built and maintain AI-driven data systems for environmental research — integrating machine learning models into high-performance ETL pipelines for processing and analyzing large-scale spatio-temporal datasets.

I enjoy working end-to-end: from backend data architecture and machine learning models to frontend visualization and user experience.
